            My name is Marin Xhemollari. I’m majoring in Computer Information Systems at OCC,
            and I’m taking this class to strengthen my web development skills and prepare for 
            a smooth transfer to university. I’m planning to transfer with my associate degree 
            and classes recommended from the universities in Fall 2026, either to UM-Dearborn or
            Wayne State for Computer Science or Cybersecurity. I enjoy both fields because I like
            using logic in creative ways to solve problems, build things, and combine ideas.</br>";

        echo  "</br>2 - Any previous programming experience?</br>
                I’ve worked with Java (my favorite so far), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, 
                and a bit of SQL.</br>";

                I collect precious metals.</br>";

                Not really—winter gets pretty busy during the 
                short two-week break. I usually prefer traveling 
                in the summer.</br>";

        echo "</br> 5 - Anything else to share with the class?</br>
                Nothing comes to mind right now, to be honest.</br>";
